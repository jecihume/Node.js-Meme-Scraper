/*
From the HTML string, get an array of strings, which will contain the URL of the image
Idea 1: Slice the string by certain identifiers
Idea 2: Look for the .jpg in the string
Extract the first 10 image URLs
Loop over the first 10 jpg image URLs
Access / navigate to the image URL
Save the response string in a variable
Make a file with the contents of the string
Maybe: check if any problems arise from rewriting the files
Preflight, commit, deploy, drone (everything in the cheatsheet)
